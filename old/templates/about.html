              <h1>Hello! Nice to meet you :)</h1>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>As you may already know, my name is Alexandre Manai.</p>
              <p>I'm a 21 year old student from Paris pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich.</p>
              <p>My parents being french and german and going to an International School with over 19 different  Nationalities,</p>
              <p>I was fortunate to experience different perspectives which
              helped me understand the importance of community, 
              </p>
              <p> sharing ideas and mutual support.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I've been playing soccer for 11 years now. Being the captain of my team taught me responsibility and leadership.</p>
              <p>I learned that being captain doesn't always mean seriousness and rigour, but flexibility and being understanding</p>
              <p>towards everyone. Trying to see each person's point of view is key to bring everyone together towards a common goal.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In my spare time, I've also been shooting videos and editing pictures especially for the instagram account</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/80cartoonz/">@80cartoonz</a>. Seeing all those creative ideas come together 
              in one end result is always so fulfilling and rewarding.</p>
              <br>
              <p>But one thing that has always interested me is how nature works. Especially Evolution and Intelligence, in the broad term.</p>
              <p>Scientific ideas and projects that turned to nature to find answers have always fascinated me. Artificial Intelligence</p>
              <p>has been my biggest interest. Understanding different algorithms and implementing them is so much fun for me!</p> 
              <br>
